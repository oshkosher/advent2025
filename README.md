Advent of Code 2025

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/).

To get input files (my code assumes their filenames will be in the form day\<n\>.in), log in to adventofcode and download each one. Advent of Code is engineered so that different users get different input files and different solution values, so yours probably won't match mine, and my code might fail on other inputs.

- [day 1](day1.py) : Moving in circles, modulo 100
- [day 2](day2.py) : Looking for numbers that consist of repeated digits
- [day 3](day3.py) : Subset of digits maximizing value
- [day 4](day4.py) : Repeated grid neighbor counting
